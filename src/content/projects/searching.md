title: "Searching with Suspense"
description: "Utilizing the power of React Suspense, this app delivers fast and seamless results with minimal load times. To make the search even more user-friendly, I've implemented debouncing, ensuring that the app only sends a request after the user has stopped typing for a certain period of time. This results in fewer requests being sent and a smoother overall experience for the user."
